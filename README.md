MethodNameRepainting
====================
Methods are important. Along namespaces and classes they give code highlevel structure. For me the name of a method is the most important part. The name communicates to me what the method does, and why it is there. Based on that information I decide whether I want to read the method body. If I can read method names faster, I can decide faster and become faster overall when working with code.

In this repository I am experimenting with techniques to make method names easier and faster to read.
* One demonstration utilizes Visual Studio Editor Adornments to insert whitespace into a CamelCase method name.
* Another demonstration utilizes Visual Studio Editor Classifiers to simply increase the fontsize of a method name of a method definition.
